How to track any Phone Number Location using python
Here I have imported phonenumbers and geocoder to get the location of the the phonenumber 

*GEOCODER* - 
Geocoder is a Python library that allows you to perform a variety of geocoding tasks, such as converting addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) and vice versa. This information can be used to display the location on a map, or to find nearby locations that match certain criteria. The library supports a variety of geocoding services such as OpenStreetMap Nominatim, Google Geocoding API, Bing Maps API, etc. It also allows you to easily switch between different providers.

What is the use of importing *PhoneNumbers* ?

The ```phonenumbers``` library in Python is used to validate, parse, and format telephone numbers. It uses the Google's libphonenumber library under the hood, which is a robust and widely-used open-source library for phone number handling.

This library can be used to- 

-> Parse phone numbers to determine their country of origin

-> Validate phone numbers to ensure they are valid and not fake numbers

-> Format phone numbers to be displayed or stored in a consistent format

-> Extract the national, international and E.164 format of the phone numbers.

-> Get the geographical location of the phone number, carrier information and more.

-> It can be used in a variety of applications such as phone number validation in a web form, phone number formatting in a customer database, or phone number verification in a messaging or voice call application.
